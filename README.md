# 30 Micro Projects
Welcome to my 30 Micro Projects Challenge! 

This repository is a collection of 30 small-scale projects I've created to enhance my programming and cybersecurity skills. Each project aims to help me progressively develop my abilities.

## Projects
1. Password Generator: Create a tool that generates secure passwords.

2. Basic Hashing Tool: Implement a tool to hash strings using SHA-256.

3. Simple Encryption/Decryption: Use the Caesar cipher for basic text encryption and decryption.

4. Port Scanner: Develop a simple tool to scan open ports on a given IP address.

5. URL Shortener: Create a basic URL shortener that stores and retrieves shortened links.

6. File Integrity Checker: Build a script that checks file integrity using checksums.

7. Basic Web Scraper: Scrape a webpage for specific data related to cybersecurity news.

8. Log File Analyzer: Create a tool to analyze system logs for suspicious activity.

9. Basic Phishing Detector: Implement a simple script to identify potentially phishing URLs.

10. Command-Line To-Do List: Develop a simple CLI application to manage tasks with secure storage.

11. Simple Keylogger: Create a keylogger that logs keystrokes to a file (ensure ethical use).

12. Network Sniffer: Build a tool that captures and analyzes packets on a local network.

13. Two-Factor Authentication: Implement a basic 2FA system using time-based tokens.

14. Web App Vulnerability Scanner: Create a tool to scan for common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQLi).

15. Secure File Transfer Tool: Develop a tool to securely transfer files over the network using encryption.

16. Brute Force Password Cracker: Implement a simple brute-force algorithm for cracking passwords.

17. Firewall Simulator: Create a basic firewall that can block or allow traffic based on rules.

18. Wi-Fi Password Cracker: Build a tool that attempts to crack WEP/WPA Wi-Fi passwords (ethical use only).

19. Social Engineering Simulator: Develop a simulation tool to educate users about social engineering attacks.

20. Data Leak Detector: Create a script that checks if emails or credentials appear in known data breaches.

21. Full-fledged Password Manager: Build a secure password manager with encryption and user authentication.

22. Malware Analysis Tool: Create a tool to analyze and classify basic malware samples.

23. Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Develop a simple IDS that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.

24. RAT (Remote Access Tool) Simulation: Create a basic RAT simulation to understand how these tools operate (ethical use only).

25. Advanced Web Application Firewall (WAF): Implement a WAF that protects against various types of attacks.

26. Blockchain for Secure Transactions: Build a simple blockchain prototype for secure transactions.

27. Exploit Development: Create a proof-of-concept for a known vulnerability in a controlled environment.

28. Penetration Testing Toolkit: Develop a set of tools to simulate penetration testing on a web application.

29. Incident Response Simulator: Create a simulator for handling cybersecurity incidents and response strategies.

30. Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform: Build a basic platform to aggregate and analyze threat intelligence data.
